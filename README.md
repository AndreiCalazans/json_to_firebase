# JSON TO FIREBASE

Simple project for you to upload a JSON file to Firebase Database. Firebase changed the ability to import a JSON file for only paid users therefore I made this NODE JS script to help me quickly upload a JSON file directly with a POST request.

## Requirements
Latest Node JS.

## Usage

**Install**
yarn or npm install

**Add .env values**
See .env values for the configs which you can find in the Firebase console.

**Add you json content inside the data.json file**


**Run the script**
In the terminal line run:
node index.js <name_of_collection>
